# WADM-ALGORITHM
This code implements the Weighted Average Decision Matrix (WADM) as found in The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco. The code is limited to two choices and three factors surrounding these choices.
In due time it will be edited and capable of handling more and more choices and factors. 
Shout out to MJ DeMarco for the Matrix I obtained from his book to make me able to write this code.
